A true Artificial Intelligent Assistant with ALICE as backend and offline speech recognition with vosk engine and pyttsx3 as text to speech engine

Unlike other assistants, this **JARVIS** is truly an ai written with ALICE files which uses Lisp as background.

Any issues on downloading and using this assistant, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/JoelShine/JARVIS-AI-ASSISTANT/issues) so I can look into the problem code. Please follow the below installation process to get it done nicely for your needs.

## About JARVIS

Jarvis is actually an ai which was introduced in the first Iron Man movie. A very spohisticated AI for Tony Stark made programmers think about making their on AI Assistants. This JARVIS also got it's inspiration fro Iron Man movies.

JARVIS - **JOEL'S ARTIFICIAL REALISTIC VIRTUAL INTERNET SERVICE"**

There had been many different versions of my Jarvis in the past few months. First, it had been a text assistnat, then speech came and this version is my first every fully artificially intelligent jarvis program with AIML. This is completely written in Python and it is compatible with almost all systems (Mac OS, Linux and Windows(Recommended)). Being written in Windows, it is more suitable to be used in Windows. Some minor changes will be needed to run on other os.

See my first JARVIS project (text to speech only) - https://github.com/JoelShine/JARVIS-The-Ultimate-Project
See my second JARVIS initiative (speech recognition) - https://github.com/JoelShine/Jarvis-v2.0

## Specialty of JARVIS

<ul>
  <li>Fully autonomous with <b>AIML</b> and <b>Lisp</b> as the brain of JARVIS.</li>
  <li>Support with offline speech recognition with the help of <b>vosk</b> models.</li>
  <li>Offline Text to Speech service with <b>pyttsx3</b>.</li>
  <li>More surer program launching mechanism.</li>
  <li>Very powerful chat mode with ALICE files.</li>
</ul>

## Setup Procedures
For getting JARVIS up and running, the instructions are given below :
### Environment setup
<ul>
  <li> <h4> You need to have Python 3.7 or later versions top run Jarvis. Jarvis is initially developed in Python 3.8.9, so getting the same version will be nice to avoid any other issues but 3.7 or later is also okay</h4> <b>Please note : Make sure to download Python 64 bit only ! Some modules are compatible only with 64 bit version.</b> <br><br> Download your python version from https://www.python.org/ <br> For getting Python 3.8.9, just click this link and download python for your os - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-389/ <br> Python 3.8.9 download for windows - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.9/python-3.8.9-amd64.exe <br></li>
  
  <li> <h4> After installing python correctly, make sure you have pip installed on your machine. Open command prompt or powershelll and type <i>pip</i> or <i>pip3</i> if something shows up, it's fine but if it says "It is not recognised as an internal or external command", just google it on how to install pip.<br><br>How to fix pip - https://www.youtube.com/resultssearch_query=how+to+fix+pip+is+not+recognized+as+an+internal+or+external+command</h4></li>
</ul>
